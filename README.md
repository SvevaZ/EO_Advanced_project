This repository contains:
- a pdf explaining the work done
- 3 Jupiter Notebooks with the code used for building the model (Model selection.ipynb), testing (Final model testing.ipynb) and make predictions (Prediction.ipynb)
- files corresponding to models generated in the code
- scaler.save file corresponding to the scaler used in preprocessing
